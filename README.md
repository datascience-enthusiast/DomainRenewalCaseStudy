# DomainRenewalCaseStudy

1) Built a model to predict Domain Renewal with almost 94% Testing Accuracy
2) Explored through Exploratory Data Analysis and understood the relationship of features.
3) Built Wordcloud to better understand what are the TOP MOST Domain Name words.
4) Used statistical analysis (ANOVA, correlation-coefficients) and graphs.
5) Did alot of Feaure Engineering and built new features to assist the model to better understand the patterns inside the data:
    1) Dervied new features Like Year, Month, Season from Variables including Date (creation_date, expiry_date)
    2) Reshaped the entire dataset from 8 columns to 580 columns with same rows.
    3) Applied Textual Preprocessing and cleaning techniques to create features from Domain Names.
    4) Using NLP - GLoVe Word Embeddings Transformed domain names to respective Vector Representations
